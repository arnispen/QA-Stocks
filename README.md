# QA-Stocks

This is a stock-predictor made with _[SciPy](https://scipy.org)_ and _[YFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)_.

***This is my first time trying to create a repository, so please don't judge me too hard!***

------

### Prerequisites

To use this application, you need Python, SciPy and YFinance installed (all preferrably installed with the latest version). I personally used `pip` (or in my case, `pip3`) for installing SciPy and yFinance, and it's up to you to decide how you want to download Python.

### How to run

If you're using **Mac/Linux**, then run:

`python3 main.py`

And if you're using **Windows**, then:

`python main.py`
