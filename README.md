# QA-Stocks

This is a stock-predictor made with [SciPy](https://scipy.org) and [YFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

***This is my first time trying to create a repository. So please don't judge me too hard!***
------

### Prerequisites

To use this application, you need Python, SciPy and YFinance installed (all preferrably installed with the latest version). I personally used `pip` (or in my case, `pip3`) for installing SciPy and yFinance, and it's up to you to decide how you want to download Python.

### How to run

If you're using Mac/Linux, then run:

`python3 main.py`

And if you're using Windows, then:

`python main.py`
